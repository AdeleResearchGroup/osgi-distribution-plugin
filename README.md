Maven OSGi Distribution plugin
===========

The OSGi Distribution plugin is used to package OSGi applications using Maven. Basically, it just copy all dependencies in
specified folders, copy the provided resources and zip the result. It also supports multiple inheritance between
distributions.
These distributions come as zip files, and can be fine tuned to have dependencies come in separate folders, with different names.

The documentation is available on :

* http://adeleresearchgroup.github.io/osgi-distribution-plugin/snapshot/ for the development version
