Maven OSGi Distribution Plugin
==================

The ${project.artifactId} is used to package OSGi applications using Maven. Basically, it just copy all dependencies in
specified folders, copy the provided resources and zip the result. It also supports multiple inheritance between
distributions.

Features
--------

* *Dependency Management*: all project dependencies (bundles, deployment packages, zip files and play applications) are
embedded in the zip file.
* *Multiple inheritance*: a distirbution can inherit from several other ones (removal of inherited file is not yet
supported).

Goals Overview
---------------

The OSGi Distribution Plugin acts on projects using the osgi-distribution packaging type during the following phases:

* [${project.artifactId}:package](./package-mojo.html) packages your OSGi application as a Zip.
* [${project.artifactId}:clean](./clean-mojo.html) cleans the project.


Usage
-----

General instructions on how to use the ${project.artifactId} can be found on the [usage page](./usage.html).
